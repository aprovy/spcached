spcached bases on spserver and spdict. More detail about spserver and spdict:

	http://code.google.com/p/spserver/
	http://code.google.com/p/spdict/

The spcached code was developed under Linux, but has also been tested under
Solaris.

You can get the code from the spcached home page:

2.Building

Before building spcached, libevent must been installed.

You can donwload libevent from its home page:

	http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

Edit spserver/Makefile to specify the path of libevent:

	LIBEVENT_INCL = -I<path_to_libevent_include>
	LIBEVENT_LIB  = -L<path_to_libevent_library> -levent


To build spcached, type

$ cd spcached
$ make

This will build the spcached program.

$ ./spcached -v
Usage: ./spcached [-p <port>] [-t <threads>]

$ ./spcached -p 11216
[msg] This server is listening on port [11216].


Any and all comments are appreciated.
