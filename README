			 spcached README

1.Introduction

spcached is a distributed memory object caching system, and implements
memcached protocol.

More detail about memcached and memcached protocol:

	http://www.danga.com/memcached/
	http://code.sixapart.com/svn/memcached/trunk/server/doc/protocol.txt

spcached bases on spserver and spdict. More detail about spserver and spdict:

	http://code.google.com/p/spserver/
	http://code.google.com/p/spdict/

The spcached code was developed under Linux, but has also been tested under
Solaris.

You can get the code from the spcached home page:

	http://code.google.com/p/spcached/

2.Building

Before building spcached, spserver and spdict must been installed. Test with
spserver 0.3 and spdict 0.2.

You can download spserver 0.3 and spdict 0.2 from its home page:

	http://code.google.com/p/spserver/downloads/list
	http://code.google.com/p/spdict/downloads/list

Edit spcached/Makefile to specify the path of spserver and spdict:

	SPSERVER_INCL = -I<path_to_spserver_include>
	SPSERVER_LIB  = -L<path_to_spserver_library> -lspserver

	SPDICT_INCL = -I<path_to_spdict_include>
	SPDICT_LIB  = -L<path_to_spdict_library> -lspdict

To build spcached, type

$ cd spcached
$ make

This will build the spcached program.

$ ./spcached -v
Usage: ./spcached [-p <port>] [-t <threads>]

$ ./spcached -p 11216
[msg] This server is listening on port [11216].


Reports of successful use of spcached are appreciated.

Enjoy!
